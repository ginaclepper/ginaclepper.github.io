      <p>Assignment: Design and fabricate a lamp to fit existing electrical innards!</p>

    <p><br>I started by printing a mini version of my telescoping lamp design as described <a href="a5-1.html">last week</a>.</p>

    <p><br><I wanted to quickly check that the opacity was what I had hoped for a single layer, and it was acceptable. The lamp was bright, but the shape of the bulb was somewhat obscured when seen through on a layer of PLA:></p>

    <p><br>Thanks to Thingiverse user HAL_9000_HAL_9000, I found a model for a <a href="https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:4274063">COVID-19 mask cord lock</a> and thought this would make a good cinching mechanism. The model involves two trapezoidal pieces which clip together enclosing a gear-like shape in between. When the gear is pushed to the narrow end of the trapezoid, the gear and outer walls pinch the cord tightly, preventing the cord from slipping through. But when the gear is pushed to the wide end of the trapezoid, there is enough room between it and the outer walls for the cord to slip past freely. In my case, gravity keeps the gear in the narrow end of the trapezoid until manually pushed to the other position:</p>

    <p><br>Flipping the cinching mechanism from the tight to the loose position lets you change how extended the lamp is:</p>
