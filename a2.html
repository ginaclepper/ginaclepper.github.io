      <p>Assignment: Create a parametric model using Grasshopper and use it to design a physical model with 30 laser-cut parts that clip together.</p>
    </div>

    <br></br>
    I decided to make a parametric version of my Assignment 1, with the following small changes:
    <ul>
      <li>Improve tolerance so fit is slightly less snug</li>
      <li>Use fillets to make slot insertion easier</li>
      <li>Support construction in more than the x-y plane</li>
    </ul>
    I hoped that with these changes, the construction kit would be more fun to construct than in v1, where it was somewhat laborious to slot pieces together and where the possible configurations were fairly limited. I decided to do away with the lily flower connector pieces from v1 and instead allow lilypads to slot with each other and serve as the connectors.

    <br></br>
    In order to get aquainted with Grasshopper, I challenged myself to use Grasshopper components alone (not other manipulations in Rhino) to re-design my lilypad shape. I was successful in this with the exception of filleting the slots, which I'll discuss later.

    <br></br>
    <h2>Modeling</h2>

    <br></br>
    I re-created the lilypad shape in three steps (grouped in purple in the Grasshopper program above):
    <ol>
      <li>Creating a circle</li>
      <li>Removing triangular divot</li>
      <li>Removing slots</li>
    </ol>

    <br></br>
    I chose three parameters to be user-input (grouped in green in the Grasshopper program above):
    <ul>
      <li>Lilypad radius (min: 1")</li>
      <img src="pics/a2-pics/param-radius.gif" width="50%" alt="Animation of lilypad radius changing."/>
      <li>Divot width (a percentage of the widest possible divot that doesn't interfere with the slots)</li>
      <img src="pics/a2-pics/param-divot.gif" width="50%" alt="Animation of lilypad divot changing."/>
      <li>Cardboard width</li>
      <img src="pics/a2-pics/param-slot.gif" width="50%" alt="Animation of width of slot in lilypad changing."/>
    </ul>

    <br></br>
    I assumed a set slot depth (0.4", same as in v1 of the construction kit).
    
    The final result, labeled "BAKE ME" (in blue), is what the user bakes and cuts.

    <br></br>
    I also tried to implement fillets with a fixed radius:

    <br></br>
    <img src="pics/a2-pics/ghp-fillet-close-up.png" width="100%" alt="A Grasshopper program that adds fillets to particular corners of a shape."/>

    <br></br>
    However, while my filleting code yielded visually correct-looking fillets, the path involved some concealed duplication, which I only realized when the laser cutter began retracing its path. I ended up doing only this filleting step in Rhino without Grasshopper.

    <br></br>
    The resulting shape:

    <h2>Fabrication</h2>
    I used the same kind of cardboard as in v1, so I already had a good set of thickness measurements. I did, however, use my slot gauge designed in Assignment 1 to select a slightly wider slot size that would still grip the slotted piece without being as snug as in the previous version:

    <br></br>
    <img src="pics/a2-pics/lilypad-lilypad.jpg" width="50%" alt="Two cardboard lilypads that slot together at a right angle."/>

    <br></br>
    Now that I had adjusted the slot size so that lilypads could slot with other lilypads, I was able to make some fun spherical shapes:

    <br></br>
    Here is a 30-piece construction:

    Slot tolerance: 0.035"
