      <p>Assignment: 3D print shapes with specified attributes and settings. Then, 3D print 15 clips that securely connect cardboard.</p>
    </div>

    <br></br>
    <h2>Basic Shapes</h2>

    Timings are ballpark:

    <br></br>
    A 2cm cube with the standard "low quality" settings:
    <ul>
      <li>Time: about 19 minutes</li>
      <li>Height: 19.72mm</li>
      <li>Width: 20.07 mm</li>
      <li>Depth: 20.08 mm</li>
    </ul>
    Adhesion issues resulted in one bad corner (slightly lifted).

    <br></br>
    A 2cm cube with the standard "standard quality" settings:
    <ul>
      <li>Time: about 24 minutes</li>
      <li>Height: 19.78 mm</li>
      <li>Width: 19.99 mm</li>
      <li>Depth: 20.02 mm</li>
    </ul>
    This cube turned out great!
    
    <br></br>
    A 2cm cube with the standard "super quality" settings:
    <ul>
      <li>Time: about 48 minutes</li>
      <li>Height: 19.90 mm</li>
      <li>Width: 19.99 mm</li>
      <li>Depth: 19.98 mm</li>
    </ul>
    The back two corners were slightly lifted; I started doing between-print bed cleanings after that.

    <br></br>
    A 2 cm cube with a concentric top and bottom layer and your favorite print setting from the previous cubes:

    <br></br>
    The concentric top and bottom layers as visualized with Cura:
    <img src="pics/a3-pics/cura_concentric.png" width="33%" alt="A visualization of a cube to be 3D printed, where the top and bottom layers have a concentric pattern."/>

    <br></br>
    <ul>
      <li>Time: about 24 minutes</li>
      <li>Height: 20.09 mm</li>
      <li>Width: 20.08 mm</li>
      <li>Depth: 20.13 mm</li>
    </ul>
    I used the "Draft" profile (standard quality) for this print and the following prints. I liked the look of the concentric top and bottom.

    <br></br>
    Bottom view:

    <br></br>
    Top view:
    <img src="pics/a3-pics/cube_concen_2.jpg" width="33%" alt="A 3D printed cube with a concentric pattern on the top"/>

    <br></br>
    A tube 3cm in diameter and 3cm high with a single extrusion wall thickness:
    <ul>
      <li>Time: about 33 minutes</li>
      <li>Height: 29.83 mm</li>
      <li>Outer radius: 29.85 mm</li>
    </ul>

    <br></br>
    There's a visible divot (at the top of the following picture and slightly to the left) where the z-seam goes along the entirety of the cube:
    <img src="pics/a3-pics/cyl_no_rnd.jpg" width="33%" alt="A 3D printed tube with a noticeable seam running along the tube where each layer of printing began and ended."/>

    <br></br>
    A tube 3cm in diameter and 3cm high with a double extrusion wall thickness and random z-seam alignment:

    <br></br>
    The random z-seam alignment as visualized with Cura:
    <img src="pics/a3-pics/cura_random_z.png" width="33%" alt="A visualization of a tube to be 3D printed. Each layer of the print starts at a different location around the cylinder, so there is no one seam in the z-direction."/>

    <br></br>
    <ul>
      <li>Time: about 38 minutes</li>
      <li>Height: 29.95 mm</li>
      <li>Outer radius: 29.91 mm</li>
    </ul>
    
    <br></br>
    The random z-seam alignment prevents the formation of a single indented seam:
    <img src="pics/a3-pics/cyl_rnd_z.jpg" width="33%" alt="A 3D printed tube; there is no noticeable seam, but there are marks along the outer edge of the tube where printing started and stopped for each layer."/>

    <br></br>
    A cylinder 3cm in diameter with special mode "spiralize outer contour":
    <ul>
      <li>Time: about 14 minutes</li>
      <li>Height: 29.97 mm</li>
      <li>Outer radius: 29.90 mm</li>
    </ul>
    This spiralize outer contour setting creates a vase-like shape with a bottom and a delicately thin (flexible) vase-like shape.

    <br></br>
    A cylinder 3cm in diameter printed on its side with supports on.
    <ul>
      <li>Time: about 36 minutes</li>
      <li>Height: 30.07 mm</li>
      <li>Radius (measured normal to print bed): 29.60 mm</li>
      <li>Radius (measured parallel to print bed): 30.06 mm</li>
    </ul>
    I ran this print using the extra fast (0.3 mm) profile and chose tree-type supports. Less support material was needed than I expected.

    <h2>Cardboard Clips</h2>

    I designed some really basic clips to attach 0.114 inch thick cardboard pieces together in the same plane. I rounded the slots for easy assembly and made the slot gap slightly smaller than the measured cardboard, knowing that the cardboard had some give.
