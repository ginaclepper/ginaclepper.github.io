      <p>Assignment: Design and mill a box out of FR1 on the Othermill, using boxjoints, tabs, or another joining method.</p>
    </div>

    <h2>Measurements</h2>
    1.54 mm seemed to be the most common FR1 depth, though there was some variance from board to board.
    
    <h2>Design</h2>

    I drafted a simple box with slots the width of the FR1:
    <img src="pics/a4-pics/side.svg" width="50%" alt="Vector sketch in Rhino of box side with puzzle-like slots and tabs."/>

    I estimated 0.1mm offset for each of the slots in my design.

    <h2>Using the Mill</h2>

    <p>Measure with tape before adhering to bed!!! z offset of 2</p>

    <p>I used the planned offset feature in the Bantam tool software to lay out multiple box sides on the available area of FR1:</p>

    <p>The sides fit together well, but I needed more pieces to be sure there wasn't an accumulation of bad tolerance errors:</p>

    <p>I needed specialized top and bottom pieces for the box!</p>

    <p>Box bottom:</p>

    <p>Box top:</p>

    <p>It fits!</p>

    <h2>Notes/Lessons Learned</h2>
    <p>The origin of the Othermill is in the front left corner!</p>

    <p>The Bantam software doesn't seem to like a blank gerber file for engraving. I worked around this, but I'm certain there's a better way!</p>

    <p>Dogbones trigger a warning about needing a smaller tool. I ignored this warning without issue -- but should I have?</p>

    <p>KiCAD doesn't like overlapping paths, and possibly may not like hidden layers that contain overlapping paths</p>

    <p>Needed to export DXF with “lines” scheme (I did most recent, 2018) for it to show up as having graphic content in KiCAD</p>

    <p>Thank you to fellow first-time Othermillers John and Jillian at the MILL for the company and troubleshooting!</p>
