      <p>Assignment: Propose a final project incorporating 4+ techniques from class!</p>
    </div>

    <h2><br>Concept</h2>
    <p>I am making a box of bones toy, where you pop the bones into their proper places on the body. The pieces are press-fit in place on a wooden box, which also serves as a place to store the pieces.</p>

    <h3><span style="background-color: lightblue;"><br>Stretch goals</span></h3>
    <p>If time allows, I will also make squishy little organs to fit into cavities.</p>

    <h3><br>Sketches</h3>

    <img src="pics/a7-pics/sketch 1.jpg" alt="" style="width:100%">

    <p>The wooden box will be about 8 by 10 inches and laser cut. The pieces will be 3D printed and will have pegs on the back that fit into the board. <span style="background-color: lightblue;"><br>Stretch goals</span>: The organs would be a combination of molded silicone and fabric pieces.</p>

    <h3><br>Intended Use Case</h3>

    <p>I want this to work as a toy that has ful tactile elements-- one that feels good to play with (e.g. has a satisfying press fit), is sturdy, utilizes a variety of materials, and could probably be played with nonvisually.</p>

    <h3><br>Context</h3>

    <p>I see these anatomical knitting models which I find so charming, and wanted to make a similar bundle of body parts that would be fun to assemble.</p>

    </div>

    <p>I also thought it would be fun to have a toy that includes the skeletal system and some other system, if possible:</p>

    <h2><br>Task Breakdown</h2>
    
    <h3><br>Rhino</h3>
    <p>I will use Rhino and Illustrator to model bones with pegs on them, as well as a press-fit box with holes in it for the pegs. </p>

    <p><span style="background-color: lightblue;">Stretch goal</span>: I will Rhino to manipulate existing models or create my own models of select organs, e.g. a brain, and to design molds to be 3D printed and cast in silicone.</p>

    <h3><br>Laser cutting</h3>
    <p>I will laser cut a press-fit box. On one face of the box, I will also laser engrave the outline of a figure laser cut holes for the bone pieces to attach to.</p>
    <p><span style="background-color: lightblue;">Stretch goal</span>: I will laser engrave another piece of wood with a torso and laser cut cavities where organs should go. This piece of wood will have box joint-like tabs to also attach to the press-fit box.</p>

    <h3><br>3D printing</h3>
    <p>I will 3D print flat toys representing individual bones or clusters of adjacent bones with pegs attached to their backs.</p>
    <p><span style="background-color: lightblue;">Stretch goal</span>: I will 3D print a mold for casting silicone organs.</p>

    <h3><br>Interference fits</h3>
    <p>The bones will be press-fit into the holes, and the pieces of the box will be press-fit together (more snugly).</p>

    <h3><br><span style="background-color: lightblue;">Stretch goal</span>: Mold design</h3>
    <p>Time permitting, I will design molds for certain squishy organs, e.g. the brain, and cast them in silicone.</p>

    <h2><br>Timeline</h2>
    <p>
      <ul>
        <li>5/17: CAD done for at least one skeleton piece</li>
        <li>5/18: At least one skeleton piece test printed</li>
        <li>5/19: Laser cut hole for pegs; successful press fit</li>
        <li>5/20: Skeleton pieces printed</li>
        <li>5/22: In class work date: CAD done for laser cut box</li>
        <li>5/22: First attempt box laser cut</li>
        <li>5/25: Deadline for attempting stretch goal of molding organs</li>
        <li>5/29: Presentation deadline</li>
        <li>5/31: Documentation deadline deadline</li>
      </ul>

    <h3><br><span style="background-color: peachpuff;"><br>Contingency plans</span></h3>

    <p><b>Outsource the design of the box</b>: use <a href="https://boxes.hackerspace-bamberg.de/">boxes.py</a> to generate the box I need.</p>

    <p><b>Abandon the box</b>: laser cut holes in wood but don't make a hinged box, just a press-fit frame; or, worst case, just a board with holes for pegs.</p>

    <p><b>Laser cut the bones</b>: If 3D printing the bones proves problematic, one contingency plan would be to laser cut delrin. On the plus side, delrin would feel nice and smooth! On the minus side, I would need to come up with an alternative means of attachment for the bones and box.</p>
