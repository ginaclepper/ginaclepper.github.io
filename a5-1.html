      <p>Assignment: combine multiple existing meshes into a new, printable mesh. Also, get started on a lamp!</p>
    </div>

    <h2><br>I. Meshes</h2>

    <p>Idea 1: waving cat with human hand, using <a href="https://ten-thousand-models.appspot.com/">Thingi10K assets</a>:</p>
    <img src="pics/a5-1-pics/cat 1.PNG" width="50%" alt=""/>

    <!-- CAT GIF HERE -->

    <p><br>Problem: the original cat mesh is bad!</p>
    <img src="pics/a5-1-pics/bad cat 1.png" width="50%" alt=""/>

    <p><br>Another problem: Still bad after MeshRepair!</p>
    <img src="pics/a5-1-pics/bad cat 2.png" width="50%" alt=""/>

    <p><br>Idea 2: octopus tentacle with splash, both also Thingi1K assets:</p>
    <img src="pics/a5-1-pics/octo 1.png" width="50%" alt=""/>

    <p><br>Rudimentary scaling, moving, and rotating yields something close but the tentacle sticks out oddly from the splash:</p>
    <img src="pics/a5-1-pics/octo 2 hi.png" width="50%" alt=""/>

    <p><br>I made a cylinder to MeshBooleanDifference with that part of the tentacle:</p>
    <img src="pics/a5-1-pics/octo 3 cyl.png" width="50%" alt=""/>

    <p><br>...yielding a better combo of tentacle and splash, with the mesh still closed, valid, and "good":</p>
    <img src="pics/a5-1-pics/octo 4 final.png" width="50%" alt=""/>

    <p><br>Still closed, valid, and "good" after MeshBooleanUnion-ing the two meshes:</p>
    <img src="pics/a5-1-pics/octo 5 good.png" width="50%" alt=""/>

    <p><br>Generating needed support in Cura:</p>
    <img src="pics/a5-1-pics/octo 6 support.png" width="50%" alt=""/>

    <p><br>Printing with LOTs of support:</p>
    <img src="pics/a5-1-pics/print 1 bed.jpg" width="50%" alt=""/>

    <p><br>After much surgery with pliers, it looks good!</p>
    <img src="pics/a5-1-pics/print 2 fwd.jpg" width="50%" alt=""/>
    <img src="pics/a5-1-pics/print 3 side.jpg" width="50%" alt=""/>

    <p><br>Support carnage:</p>
    <img src="pics/a5-1-pics/print 4 support sqr.jpg" width="50%" alt=""/>

    <p><br>Source files: , <a href="source/src-a5-1/combo_3.3dm">Rhino file for tentacle + splash</a></p>

    <p><br>References: <a href="source/src-a5-1/OcotoArm-v3-Final-11mmCase.stl">original tentacle asset</a>, <a href="source/src-a5-1/Splash_Pen_holderV04.stl">original splash asset</a></p>

    <h2><br>II. Lamps</h2>

    <p><br>Ideation:</p>
    <img src="pics/a5-1-pics/sketch 1-2-01.jpg" width="50%" alt=""/>

    <p><br>One of my most prized possessions as a child was a telescoping lightsaber toy. It was made of nested truncated cones that would telescope out to form the blade or collapse when pretending to stab your friends or enemies:</p>
    <img src="pics/a5-1-pics/lightsaber.jpg" width="50%" alt=""/>
    <p><a href="https://www.ebay.com/itm/275267449538">(source)</a></p>

    <p><br>I thought this might make an interesting lamp design for a hanging lamp suspended low over my work desk. In its hanging form, it would be fully telescoped. By either lowering the cord or stacking things (e.g. books) underneath, I could put it into collapsed form, where less light could shine through. There would be lots of variables to play with:
      <ul>
        <li>Thickness of each layer -- affects how much can shine through</li>
        <li>Length of each chunk of the telescope -- also affects opacity</li>
        <li>Angle variation -- affects how much the lamp can wiggle</li>
        <li>etc.</li>
      </ul>
    </p>
